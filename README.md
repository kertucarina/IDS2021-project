# IDS2021-project
Group C7. Project within the course Introduction to Data Science LTAT.02.002 .

The code for this project is contained within three Jupyter Notebook notebooks.

The data required for this project, the 2015 BRFSS survey, is not included in this GitHub repository due to its size. You can download it from Kaggle (2015.csv): https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system?select=2015.csv. Place the dataset into the folder named "datasets" so the code would function properly.

The first notebook is "preprocessing-data.ipynb" which contains the code for preprocressing the data. You must run this notebook first before either of the other two. The running order of the other two notebooks does not matter though.

The second notebook is "correlated-features.ipynb" which contains the code for analyzing the dataset and correlating features to heart disease classification in order to predict which features could be most important for identifying heart disease.

The third notebook is "predictive-models.ipynb" which contains the code for the classification models and the analysis of the best model.
